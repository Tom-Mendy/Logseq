### **History and Background**
- **Developed by**: Torkel Ödegaard
- **Year**: 2014
- **Location**: Initially started as a personal project by the founder; later evolved with contributions from a wide community.
- **Purpose**: Grafana was created to provide a robust platform for querying, visualizing, alerting on, and understanding metrics regardless of where they are stored.
- ### **Key Features**
- **Versatile Data Source Support**: Grafana can ingest data from a variety of sources, including #Prometheus, #Graphite, #InfluxDB, #Elasticsearch, and many more.
- **Dynamic Dashboards**: Users can create highly customizable and interactive dashboards for real-time visualization.
- **Alerting**: Grafana offers alerting functionalities to notify users when certain conditions are met in the metrics it monitors.
- **Transformations and Queries**: Supports complex transformations and queries enabling users to manipulate data on-the-fly.
- **User Management**: Grafana offers robust user management and access control to manage and secure the dashboards.
- ### **Basic Syntax**
- **Panels**: Grafana dashboards are comprised of panels, each representing a specific visualization of metrics.
- **Queries**: Different data sources have their own query languages and structures that can be used within Grafana's query editor.
- **Variables**: Grafana supports variables in dashboards, making them dynamic and reusable for multiple instances or deployments.
- **Alerts**: Alerts can be configured using threshold conditions and can trigger notifications via email, Slack, webhooks, and other channels.
- ### **Example Dashboard Configuration**
  
  Here’s a simple example of a Grafana dashboard configuration in JSON format:
  
  ```json
  
  {
  
  "title": "Sample Dashboard",
  
  "panels": [
  
    {
  
      "type": "graph",
  
      "title": "CPU Usage",
  
      "targets": [
  
        {
  
          "expr": "avg(rate(node_cpu_seconds_total[5m])) by (job)",
  
          "legendFormat": "{{job}}"
  
        }
  
      ],
  
      "id": 1
  
    }
  
  ]
  
  }
  
  ```
