- **Extensible**: Supports a wide range of extensions available through the Visual Studio Code Marketplace. Users can add new languages, themes, debuggers, and more.
- **IntelliSense**: Advanced code completion feature that provides smart completions based on variable types, function definitions, and imported modules.
- **Debugging**: Includes robust debugging capabilities, allowing developers to debug their code directly from the editor.
- **Integrated Terminal**: Comes with a built-in terminal that supports command-line operations, reducing the need to switch windows.
- **Customization**: Highly customizable through settings, keybindings, snippets, and extensions.
- **Live Share**: Enables real-time collaboration with other developers by sharing your code and session.
- ### **Basic Usage**
- **Installation**: Available as a free download from the official website. Installation wizards are available for different operating systems.
- **Extensions**: Can be installed via the Extensions view (accessed with `Ctrl+Shift+X` or `Cmd+Shift+X` on macOS). Examples include Python, Prettier, ESLint, etc.
- **Keyboard Shortcuts**:
	- **Open Command Palette**: `Ctrl+Shift+P` (`Cmd+Shift+P` on macOS)
	- **Toggle Terminal**: `Ctrl+` or `` `Control+` `` (`Cmd+` on macOS)
	- **Search Files**: `Ctrl+P` (`Cmd+P` on macOS)
- ### **Example Code Editing**
  
  Hereâ€™s a basic example of using Visual Studio Code to create a simple "Hello, World!" program:
  
  1. **Open VS Code**: Install and open the Visual Studio Code application.
  
  2. **Create a New File**: Open a new file (with `Ctrl+N` or `Cmd+N` on macOS) and save it with a `.c` extension for a C program.
  
  3. **Write Code**:
  
  ```c
  
  #include <stdio.h>
  
  int main() {
  
    printf("Hello, World!\n");
  
    return 0;
  
  }
  
  ```
  
  4. **Run Code**: Use the integrated terminal to compile and run the program.
- ### **Applications**
- **Web Development**: Supports a variety of web development frameworks and libraries, including React, Angular, and Vue.
- **Python Development**: Extensively used for Python scripting with special support for Django and Flask.
- **Node.js Development**: Comes with built-in support for Node.js, making it easy to create and manage Node.js applications.
- **Data Science**: Often used for data analysis and manipulation with Jupyter Notebooks extensions.
- **Embedded Systems**: Good support for C/C++ development makes it useful for embedded systems development.
- ### **Influence**
  
  VS Code has become one of the most popular text editors in the developer community, highly regarded for its speed, functionality, and customization. It has influenced other editors and IDEs to adopt similar features and extensibility models.
- ### **Why Use Visual Studio Code?**
- **Cross-Platform**: Works across all major operating systems, ensuring a consistent development experience.
- **Community and Support**: Backed by a robust ecosystem with frequent updates and a plethora of available extensions.
- **Productivity**: Numerous features that help in boosting productivity, such as code navigation, refactoring, and integrated Git.
