### **History and Background**
- **Developed by**: Acorn Computers Ltd (initially), currently maintained by ARM Holdings
- **Year**: 1983 (first ARM processor, ARM1, was developed in 1985)
- **Location**: Cambridge, UK
- **Purpose**: Initially designed for low-energy consumption and high performance, making it ideal for a variety of applications from embedded systems to mobile devices.
- ### **Key Features**
- **RISC Architecture**: ARM stands for Advanced RISC Machine. The Reduced Instruction Set Computing architecture means each instruction is designed to execute very quickly.
- **Low Power Consumption**: ARM processors are highly energy-efficient, which is essential for mobile and embedded devices.
- **Scalability**: ARM architecture is highly scalable from small microcontrollers to large multicore processors.
- **Large Ecosystem**: ARM has a vast and diverse ecosystem, making it easier for #[[developers]] to find the tools and software they need.
- **Licensing Model**: ARM Holdings does not manufacture the processors but licenses the technology to other companies, fostering innovation and variety in implementation.
- ### **Basic Architecture**
- **Registers**: ARM features a set of 16 general-purpose registers (R0-R15) along with status registers.
- **Instruction Set**: ARM's instruction set includes arithmetic, logical operations, data movement, control flow, and more.
- **Modes**: Supports multiple operating modes for different tasks (e.g., User mode, FIQ, IRQ, Supervisor, Abort, Undefined, and System modes).
- **Thumb and Thumb-2**: Compact instruction sets for improved energy efficiency in smaller devices.
- ### **Typical Syntax (Assembly)**
  
  Here's a simple "Hello, World!" in ARM Assembly:
  
  ```assembly
    .section    .data
  output: .asciz "Hello, World!\n"
    .section    .text
    .global     _start
  _start:
    ldr         r0, =1          @ file descriptor (stdout)
    ldr         r1, =output     @ address of "Hello, World!"
    ldr         r2, =14         @ message length
    mov         r7, #4          @ syscall number (sys_write)
    svc         0               @ make syscall
    mov         r7, #1          @ syscall number (sys_exit)
    svc         0               @ make syscall
  ```
- ### **Applications**
