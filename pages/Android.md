- **Frequent Updates**: Regular updates and security patches are provided by Google.
- ### **Basic Components**
- **Activity**: Represents a single screen with a user interface.
- **Service**: A component that runs in the background to perform long-running operations.
- **Broadcast Receiver**: Allows the system to deliver events to the app outside of a regular user flow.
- **Content Provider**: Manages access to a structured set of data.
- ### **Development Tools**
- **#[[Android Studio]]**: The official integrated development environment (IDE) for Android development.
- **[[Kotlin]] & #[[Java]]**: Primary programming languages used for Android development.
- **#[[XML]]**: Used for designing user interface layouts.
- **#[[Android SDK]]**: Software development kit that provides the necessary tools to develop Android applications.
- **AVD (Android Virtual Device)**: Emulator for testing Android applications.
- ### **Example Code**
  
  Hereâ€™s a simple example of an "Hello, World!" application in Android:
  
  ```xml
  <!-- res/layout/activity_main.xml -->
  <LinearLayout xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"
    xmlns:tools="http://schemas.android.com/tools"
    android:layout_width="match_parent"
    android:layout_height="match_parent"
    android:orientation="vertical"
    tools:context=".MainActivity">
    <TextView
        android:layout_width="wrap_content"
        android:layout_height="wrap_content"
        android:text="Hello, World!" />
  </LinearLayout>
  ```
  
  ```kotlin
  
  // MainActivity.kt
  package com.example.helloworld
  import android.os.Bundle
  import androidx.appcompat.app.AppCompatActivity
  class MainActivity : AppCompatActivity() {
    override fun onCreate(savedInstanceState: Bundle?) {
        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState)
