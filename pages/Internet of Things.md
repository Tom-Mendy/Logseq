### **History and Background**
- **Concept Coined by**: Kevin Ashton
- **Year**: 1999
- **Purpose**: To describe a system where physical objects are connected to the internet, allowing them to communicate and interact with their environment and other connected devices.
- ### **Key Features**
- **Connectivity**: IoT devices are connected to the internet, which enables data exchange between devices.
- **Sensing**: IoT devices typically include sensors that collect data from the physical environment.
- **Data Processing**: Collected data is processed either locally on the device or sent to cloud servers for processing.
- **Automation and Control**: Based on [[Data Analysis]], IoT systems can perform automated actions without human intervention.
- **Interoperability**: Devices from different manufacturers can communicate with each other through standard protocols.
- ### **Basic Components**
- **Sensors/Devices**: Collect data from the physical environment (e.g., temperature sensors, cameras, GPS trackers).
- **Connectivity**: Means of communication (e.g., Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, cellular networks) to transmit collected data.
- **Data Processing**: Local or cloud-based processing to analyze and derive insights from the data.
- **User Interface**: User-facing applications (e.g., mobile apps, web dashboards) for monitoring and control purposes.
- **Actuators**: Components that act upon the data analysis and perform physical actions (e.g., opening a valve, turning on lights).
- ### **Example Scenario**
  
  Hereâ€™s an example of a smart home IoT system:
- **Sensors**: Temperature sensors, motion detectors, door/window sensors.
- **Connectivity**: Wi-Fi network connecting the sensors to a central hub or cloud server.
