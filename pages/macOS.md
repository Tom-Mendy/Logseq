- **Foundation**: Built on the Unix-based NeXTSTEP and influenced by the classic Mac OS.
- ### **Key Features**
- **Unix-based Architecture**: macOS is built on a #Unix foundation, providing robust performance, security, and command-line utilities.
- **Aqua User Interface (UI)**: Known for its visually appealing and intuitive graphical user interface.
- **Integration with Apple Ecosystem**: Seamlessly integrates with other Apple devices and services like #iPhone, #iPad, #[[Apple Watch]], #iCloud, and more.
- **Core Technologies**: Includes powerful frameworks such as #Metal (graphics and compute API), Core ML (machine learning), and Swift (programming language).
- **Security**: Features state-of-the-art security measures including Gatekeeper, XProtect, FileVault encryption, and System Integrity Protection.
- **App Store**: Provides a centralized location for discovering, purchasing, and updating apps specifically for macOS.
- ### **Basic Elements**
- **Finder**: The default file manager used to browse the file system.
- **Dock**: A quick-launch bar for applications, document shortcuts, and minimized windows.
- **Menu Bar**: Located at the top of the screen, it provides menu options and system controls.
- **System Preferences**: A hub for customizing system settings and preferences.
- **Terminal**: A command-line interface for more advanced system commands and scripting.
- ### **Example Code Integration**
  
  Although macOS is primarily used with graphical applications, you can write C code and compile it using the Terminal. Hereâ€™s a slightly modified "Hello, World!" program:
  
  ```c
  #include <stdio.h>
  int main() {
    printf("Hello, World from macOS!\n");
    return 0;
  }
  ```
  
  Compile and run using Terminal:
  
  ```sh
  gcc hello.c -o hello
  ./hello
  ```
- ### **Applications**
